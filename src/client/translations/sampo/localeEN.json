  "aboutThePortalPartOne": "<h1 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> About the Portal </h1> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> This portal provides an interactive and semantically enriched interface to explore and analyze linked data related to [your domain, e.g., movies, historical events, people]. It is built using the Sampo-UI framework, which supports faceted search, data visualizations, and multilingual features to enhance user experience. The portal is designed for both casual users and researchers, offering multiple perspectives and views tailored to different types of information.</p> <h2 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Data </h2> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> The data presented in this portal is based on structured RDF datasets published according to Linked Data principles. Each item is described using standardized vocabularies and ontologies to ensure interoperability and semantic consistency. The data includes entities such as [examples: films, characters, people, roles], linked through meaningful relationships that allow for deep and flexible exploration.</p>",
  "aboutThePortalPartTwo": "<h2 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Data Reuse </h2> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\">All data in this portal is openly available for reuse under applicable licenses. Researchers, developers, and institutions are encouraged to use the data for academic, educational, or technical purposes. The structured nature of the data allows for easy integration into other projects, visualizations, or semantic web applications. SPARQL endpoints and APIs are available for advanced data access.</p> <h2 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> More Information </h2> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> For further details about the data model, technical implementation, or usage instructions, please visit the documentation section or contact the portal administrators. The portal is developed and maintained as part of an ongoing effort to make linked data accessible and usable to a wider audience. Contributions and feedback are always welcome to improve the platform.</p>",
  "instructions": "<h1 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Instructions </h1> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> The search functionality of this semantic portal is based on the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2200/S00190ED1V01Y200904ICR005\" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'> faceted search</a> paradigm. By default each perspective displays all results from the corresponding class. This default result set can be narrowed down by using the filters on the left. </p> <h2 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Using a single filter </h2> <h3 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Selecting values within a filter </h3> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> All possible values for a filter are displayed either as a list or as a hierarchical tree structure (if available). The number of results is shown in brackets for each value. Once a value is selected, the results are automatically updated. To prevent further selections that do not return any results, also the possible values for all other filters are updated at the same time. </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> Multiple values can be selected within a single filter. Selecting multiple values generates results that contain any of the selected values. For example, selecting both <i>Saint Augustine</i> and <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author returns results that include either <i>Saint Augustine</i> <strong>OR</strong> <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author. </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> Selected values of a filter appear in the Active filters section at the top of the list of filters. To deselect a filter, click the X mark next to it within the Active filters section. You can also deselect a filter value by unchecking the checkmark in the filter’s value list. The Active filters section only appears if there are filter values currently selected. </p> <h3 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Searching within a filter </h3> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> Search within a filter by using the search field at the top of each filter. All possible values of a filter remain visible at all times. The values of the filter that match the search term are indicated by a purple underline. </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> Steps for searching within filters: </p> <ol class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> <li> Type search term into search field. If there are matches, a number will appear to the right of the search field, indicating the number of filter values that match the search term. </li> <li> Click the arrows to the right of the search field to cycle through the results. As you click the arrow, a different filter value will appear at the top of the list. Matched filters are underlined in purple. </li> <li> Click the checkmark next to a filter value to activate it. The results (and also other filters) are automatically updated. </li> </ol> <h2 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Using multiple filters simultaneously </h2> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> The effectiveness of faceted search is realized when multiple filters are applied at the same time. As in many e-commerce sites, a logical AND is always used between the filters. For example selecting <i>Saint Augustine </i> and <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author and <i>Sir Thomas Phillipps</i> and <i> Thomas Thorpe</i> as an Owner, the results are narrowed down as follows: </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\"> (Author: <i>Saint Augustine</i> <strong>OR</strong> Author: <i>Saint Jerome</i>) </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\"> <strong>AND</strong> </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\"> (Owner: <i>Sir Thomas Phillipps</i> <strong>OR</strong> Owner: <i>Thomas Thorpe</i>) </p>",
